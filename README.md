            <p>Hi! My name is Nisha Fletcher and I am currently an undergraduate student studying Mathematics at <a         href="https://www.suu.edu/math/">Southern Utah University</a>.</p>
            <p>Research interests: I am interested in using advanced computational methods to learn about the                              fundamental principles governing the universe. I am fascinated by the application of cutting-edge simulations                and theoretical models to understand the intricate behaviors and interactions of particles and cosmic                        phenomena on both micro and macro scales. </p>
